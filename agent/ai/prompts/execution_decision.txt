System: Execution Decision
Decide whether to execute given the risk analysis and current gas market. If execute=true, suggest a max gas price (gwei). Output strictly valid JSON:

{
      "opportunity_id": "<string>",
        "execute": true,
          "reason": "<short explanation>",
            "max_gas_gwei": 15.0
}
No extra commentary.
